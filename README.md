1) A metropolitan transport authority aims to construct, organize, manipulate, display, and
validate a sophisticated menu driven network segmentation and control system for a city
wide smart transportation infrastructure. The system must analyze segmented traffic control
networks and provide advanced diagnostics, including:
• Total network segments and connected field devices
• Inter segment communication success and failure counts
• Broadcast containment effectiveness
• Traffic isolation behavior across control zones
• Detection of unauthorized devices or misconfigured ports
• Optional advanced metrics such as emergency override performance
The system must support real time interaction, nested configuration and diagnostic operations,
and repeated validation cycles. Students must join, invite, form, read, work, and report
collaboratively. Screenshots must include VLAN configuration, trunk links, routing behavior,
access control verification, and packet simulation.
[13 Marks] [CLO-2, P4, PLO-10, CLO-3, A3, PLO-6]
Core Requirements
The group must construct a fully modular segmented network that:
• Organizes devices into logical segments based on operational roles
• Implements controlled inter segment routing
• Applies access restrictions for critical subsystems
• Identify segment membership and device roles
b. Measure isolation and broadcast containment
c. Verify allowed and denied traffic paths

2) An international financial services firm aims to construct, organize, manipulate, display, and
validate a sophisticated menu driven enterprise internet access and NAT analysis system
connecting multiple global branches. The system must analyze secure external access and
provide advanced diagnostics, including:
• Total internal hosts accessing external services
• Active NAT translations and port utilization
• Transaction success and failure counts
• Detection of translation conflicts or misconfigured gateways
• Scalability behavior under peak load
• Optional advanced metrics such as session persistence
The system must support real time interaction, nested diagnostics, and repeated validation.
Students must join, invite, form, read, work, and report collaboratively. Screenshots must
include NAT tables, routing outputs, packet flow, and performance analysis.
